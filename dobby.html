  <p>

  <p>As a sign of his gratitude Dobby became as loyal to Harry Potter as any member of the  infamous Dumbledore's Army and help Harry' out on a number of occasions. This unwavering loyalty to the Wizard that had freed him, ultimately ended in him give his life to save Harry and his companions and the prisons of He who Must No Be Name.
  </p>

  <p>Though Dobby was only free for a for a couple of years this left huge impact on the Wizardry Society, to this day when a Wizard or Witich intervenes to save a Muggles life it called “Doing a Dobby”. In his memory a new Position of "Free Elf" , basically a Elf liaison officer , was created in the  Department for the Regulation and Control of Magical Creatures. This is a paid position for any Elf . The current holder is Dobby's good friend Winky..</p>
