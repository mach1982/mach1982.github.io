		<h1>About Me</h1>
	
			<p> My two passions are coding and cybersecurity.For nearly 10 I mentored in not one Coder Dojo but two.In 2018/2019 I tried switching career to Data Analytics , 
			I was ok with coding side , but not the  Analytics, so when Covid hit I though give Cybersecurity a shot. For the past 3-4 years I focused on getting a role in Cybersecurity. I did achieve that goal in November 2012, got a SOC role with Rapid7, unfortunately it did not work out.
			I now realise that I not suited to career that involves analytics. I need something that is pure code , and that is Web Development. As I  have no real experience , the best way to get a role is to have portfolio that why this page is or  
			Below are some of my projects:</p>
