		<p> Consider this as my portfolio. The site should be consider under construction. I neglected it for the last few years so  I'm  keep  simple for now , with just basic HTML , and a bit of CSS.

		<h1>About Me</h1>
		   
	
			<p> My two passions are coding and cybersecurity.For nearly 10 years I mentored in not one Coder Dojo but two.In 2018/2019 I tried switching career to Data Analytics , 
			I was ok with coding side , but not the  Analytics, so when Covid hit I though give Cybersecurity a shot. For the past 3-4 years I focused on getting a role in Cybersecurity. 
			I did achieve that goal in November 2012, got a SOC role with Rapid7, unfortunately it did not work out. So decided to give coding another go, in particular Web Development. 
			 
			Below are some of my projects:</p>
